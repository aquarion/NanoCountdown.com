NanoCountdown, aka #BastardWidget
=================================

A motivation tool for NaNoWriMo participants.


Notes & Queries:
----------------

Part of the motivation for this was that I've been overly reliant on jQuery and such libraries for anything moderately complicated in JavaScript, so this is entirely raw JS.

it's not really particually good raw JS, though, so a complete rewrite in something like Zepto might happen at some point.


The original idea was from a module I wrote for aquarion/lampstand.
